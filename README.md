# Amitabh. Portfolio 2026

A high-performance DevOps portfolio designed for technical authority and minimalist aesthetic. This project focuses on refined interactions, efficient performance, and clear communication of engineering expertise.

## Core Technologies

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router) for optimized rendering and routing.
- **Runtime**: React 19 using the latest concurrent features.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 for utility-first design without runtime overhead.
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for hardware-accelerated transitions.
- **Scrolling**: Lenis for inertial scrolling experiences.

## Technical Highlights

### System Pulse

The portfolio features a real-time GitHub activity indicator. It polls the GitHub API every 60 seconds to provide accurate status updates. The implementation includes cache-busting and CORS management to ensure reliability across production environments.

### Modular Architecture

The codebase is structured for maintainability and performance:

- **UI Components**: Atomic, reusable elements located in `src/components/ui`.
- **Page Sections**: Modular sections in `src/components/sections`, utilizing dynamic imports to minimize the initial load time.

### User Experience

- **Interactive Elements**: Custom magnetic interactions, glass-morphism effects, and refined hover states.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Typography and spacing are specifically calibrated for small-screen devices.
- **Unified Scrolling**: Blends Lenis inertial scrolling with native CSS smooth behavior for a consistent feel.
